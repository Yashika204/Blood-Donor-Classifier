**🩸 Blood Donor Classifier using Hybrid Naïve Bayes Decision Tree (HNBDT)**



**🚀 Introduction**

The Blood Donor Classifier is an innovative project that leverages the Hybrid Naïve Bayes Decision Tree Algorithm (HNBDT) to efficiently categorize potential blood donors based on specific blood type requirements. Achieving an impressive 89% accuracy, this project simplifies and streamlines donor classification for blood donation services.



**🌟 Key Features**

✅ Machine Learning Integration: Implemented the HNBDT Algorithm combining the power of Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree techniques.

✅ High Accuracy: Achieved a commendable 89% accuracy in predicting donor classifications.

✅ Interactive Android App: Developed using React Native for intuitive user experience.

✅ Backend with Flask API: Ensures seamless communication between the app and the classification model.

✅ Firebase Integration: Enables secure data storage and real-time updates.



**🛠️ Tech Stack**

🐍 Python: Data processing, model training, and prediction.

🌐 Flask API: Backend integration for serving model predictions.

📱 React Native: Frontend development for the Android app.

🔥 Firebase: Real-time data management and user authentication. 




**📥 Installation & Setup**

Step 1: Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blood-Donor-Classifier.git
    cd Blood-Donor-Classifier


Step 2: Backend Setup

    Navigate to the backend folder:
    cd backend

    Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .\venv\Scripts\activate

    Install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Flask API:
    python app.py


Step 3: Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend folder:
    cd frontend

    Install dependencies:
    npm install

    Run the app:
    npm start




**📲 Usage**

Launch the Android app and provide the necessary details such as age, blood type, and medical history.

The system will predict the donor category using the HNBDT Algorithm.

The prediction details are securely stored in Firebase for easy access.




**📊 Results**

📈 Accuracy: 89% on test data.

🚨 Performance Improvement: The hybrid model outperforms traditional Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms individually.




**🔮 Future Enhancements**

Improve prediction accuracy using ensemble learning techniques.

Implement additional security layers for donor data.

Introduce multi-language support for the Android app.
